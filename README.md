The basic structure of this app allows users to create "communities" such as for a city, a school, an organization, sports team etc. and configure those "communities" with customizable extensions including features for publishing events from large corporate sponsored to a simple pick up basketball game, and an "ambassador" feature that allows user to register as an ambassador for their community to help those new to a community integrate smoothly.

HOW TO OPEN APP ON YOUR IPHONE:

*Note: You will need a mac to do this. If you dont own a mac, you can visit doSpace to use one.

1. Ensure XCode is installed on the computer you are using

2. Click the green button at the top right of this page that says "Clone or Download"

3. When the drop down menu appears below "Clone or Download", select "Open in XCode"

4. When in XCode, at the top left of the screen will be a play button, a stop button, 
and then a bar that has the name of the app on the left side and will say something 
like "Generic IOS Device" on the right. Click where it says "Generic IOS Device" and 
a menu of choices will appear.

5. To run on your phone (ensure the phone is connected to the computer), scroll 
to the top of the menu where your device should be listed. To run a simulation of the 
app on the computer, scroll towards the bottom and select what kind of device you would
like to simulate the app on, ie. "IPhone 8"

6. Then click the play button (that looks like an arrow) to run the app on your selected device.
